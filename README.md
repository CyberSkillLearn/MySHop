## 🎨 Design Language

### Color Palette
[cite_start]We used a high-contrast, professional theme to reflect luxury branding[cite: 214]:
* [cite_start]**Primary Black (`#000000`)**: Used for header, footer, and structure[cite: 214, 216].
* [cite_start]**Accent Red (`#FF0000`)**: Used for interactive hover effects and call-to-action buttons[cite: 214, 217].
* [cite_start]**Soft Grey (`#D9D9D9`)**: Used for product card backgrounds to make the images pop[cite: 214, 219].

### Typography
* [cite_start]**Primary**: Arial (Sans Serif) for clean, modern readability[cite: 222].
* [cite_start]**Branding**: Brush Script MT (Cursive) for an elegant "Art of Fragrance" feel[cite: 223].

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **HTML5**: Structured for accessibility and clean semantic hierarchy.
* [cite_start]**CSS3**: Features custom hover transitions, grid/flexbox alignments, and styled form inputs[cite: 214].
